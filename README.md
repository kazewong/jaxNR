# JaxNR - Numerical Relativity with JAX

This is an experimental package (hopefully for my last time) to implement GPU accelerated numerical relativity simulations.
Here is a list of features that I would like to implement:

- [] Fixed topology FEM methods
- [] Scaling to multiple GPU nodes
- [] Automatic differentiation
- [] Machine learning controller
